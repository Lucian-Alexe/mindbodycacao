                EMDR is an effective therapy for healing trauma by reprocessing distressing memories and emotions. Using bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements), EMDR helps rewire the brain’s response to traumatic experiences, allowing clients to heal from PTSD, anxiety, and depression. This approach is highly effective for those who’ve experienced domestic abuse, childhood trauma, or complex PTSD.
